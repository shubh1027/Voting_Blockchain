# Voting_Blockchain
It is a Voting System Smart Contract in which the voters vote for the candidates and each voter have a single vote.
In it I have defined two structs Canditate and Voter and we can assign multiple properties to them.
To keep track of Voters and Candidates, I have put them into separate mappings where they are integer indexed.
